# Vulcan Labs Interview Case for Android Developers
You have been invited to an assigned section. A requirement before the interview is to finish this task in 45 minutes. Please take your time and do not rush things, this case project is very important in evaluating your proficiency in app development. 

Please read the **Q&A for both Design and Coding** so that you are not lost on what requirements you need.

## Task details
- You are provided a Figma design. Please implement the UI and as much as you can. For the missing UI assets, you may use the Internet to find anything that can replace the design. YOU should decide on what should be added and what should not.
- Make network call to get **JSON DB** as an API's respone to fill UI elements

- Resources:
	+ Figma design: https://github.com/longnguyen2605/vulcan_labs_assignment_1/blob/main/profile_design.fig
	+ JSON DB: https://github.com/longnguyen2605/vulcan_labs_assignment_1/blob/main/db.json


## Design Q&A
- How should the **images** be displayed?

You have the freedom to implement it any way you want. 
Here is an example of implementation: The images on the top should be switched when you swipe the screen in that area while the images on the bottom should be fullscreen if you tap on one of them.

- How do I download the Figma **assets**?

You can export all the assets as SVG-files individually or in chunks. Please use Google if you have zero experience with Figma, we expect you to be able to find the information yourself.


## Coding FAQs
- What **language** should I use?

We are working in **Android** so we would *prefer* if you wrote it in **Kotlin** to align with our tech stack. However, we will accept  **Java** code as well if that is what you prefer.

- Do I have any limitations on what **dependencies or packages** I can use?

No, not at all. Do your best work and if you feel that you need to take assets from other places it's perfectly normal.

- Do I need to follow any coding patterns such as **MVP, or MVVM**?

Yes, coding should be ruled to avoid messily


## Evaluation
Here are some specific evaluation metrics we will use:
- **Coding practice** - We don’t want to see messy code. We want to see well-structured and well-commented code such that a new developer joining the project should be able to understand it without any problems.
- **Implementation skills** - We want to see how you manage to implement the requirements given by the case. Are some things too hard? Are some things implemented in a really innovative way? There are many ways to impress or disappoint us here.
- **Design choices** - Even though we will have designers and other creative people on the team, we really value developers that can identify what looks good and what looks bad. Because in the end, it’s us app developers who are the people finalizing the product.
- There are other things as well that we will check such as performance, future planning, and how well you present your thinking during the interview.

Vulcan Labs wants strong problem-solvers with a creative mindset. We are a startup with a lot of ambition and the people who work with us are hard-working and innovative. Therefore, this task is very open-ended and can be solved in a multitude of ways. As an app developer, you need to know when a design choice is good, redundant, or even outright bad. Here in Vulcan Labs, we encourage everyone to come up with their own ideas and to give constant constructive feedback to each other, so feel free to get creative!

Happy coding and good luck!
